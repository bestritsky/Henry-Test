# PRD: Henry Bestritsky - The Digital Trust Engine
**Version 1.0 | January 18, 2026**

## 1. Executive Vision
This is not a consultant's portfolio. It is a **Digital Trust Engine**.
In a market saturated with AI noise, this platform serves as a filter for truth. It doesn't just "present services"; it demonstrates the intellectual rigor and executive gravity of Henry Bestritsky. It is designed to stop a C-suite executive in their scroll and make them say, *"Finally, an adult in the room."*

**Core Philosophy:** *Trust Over Tools.*
**Vibe:** Cyber-Executive. Think "Minority Report" meets "Succession." High stakes, clean data, deep precision.

## 2. Inventive Feature Set

### A. The "Hype vs. Reality" Global Toggle ⚡
**Concept:** A sticky switch in the navigation bar.
- **State A (Default - "Vision"):** The site uses aspirational language ("Transform decision making," "Accelerate growth"). Visuals are abstract, glowing, ethereal.
- **State B (Toggled - "Reality"):** The site performs a visible "phase shift."
    - **Visuals:** Snap to wireframe/schematic view.
    - **Text:** Rewrites itself instantly to brutal pragmatism.
    - *Example:* "Transform decision making" -> "Fix your dirty data so you don't automate mistakes."
    - *Value:* Instantly proves Henry understands both the dream and the plumbing.

### B. The "Red Phone" Interface (AI Rescue) 🚨
**Concept:** Instead of a generic contact form for distressed clients.
- A discreet implementation of a "Panic Button" aesthetic in the "AI Rescue" section.
- **Interaction:** Hovering triggers a subtle pulse. Clicking opens a high-priority modal: *"Project Status: CRITICAL."*
- **Form:** Skips the niceties. "How much have you spent?" "What is the symptom?" (Stalled / Hallucinating / Security Breach).
- **Feedback:** "Priority triage protocol initiated. Henry will see this within 2 hours."

### C. The "MSP Multiplier" Calculator 🧮
**Concept:** A specialized interactive tool for Managed Service Providers.
- **Input:** Number of clients, Average seat count.
- **Output:** Live projection of "Unclaimed AI Revenue" using Henry's white-label model.
- **Visuals:** Data visualization that grows as the slider moves, showing the exponential value of partnering vs. building in-house.

### D. The "Black Box" (PE Due Diligence) ⬛
**Concept:** A section that feels restricted/classified.
- **Design:** Darker, heavier UI. "Restricted Access" vibes.
- **Content:** An interactive checklist of "Deadly Sins in AI Acquisitions."
- **Hook:** "You check the financials. We check the hallucination rates."

## 3. Visual & Interaction Design System

### Aesthetic: "Void & Photon"
- **Backgrounds:** Deepest void black (#030305), not gray.
- **Lighting:** Dynamic "photon" glows that follow the cursor, illuminating content like a flashlight in a dark server room.
- **Typography:**
    - *Headings:* `Space Grotesk` - Technical, futuristic but legible.
    - *Body:* `Inter` or `Geist Sans` - The standard for readability.
    - *Accents:* `JetBrains Mono` - For "code" or "data" elements.
- **Motion:**
    - Heavy use of `Framer Motion`.
    - **Scroll:** Smooth parallax, elements "lock" into place with magnetic precision.
    - **Text:** Words decode/unscramble into view (like a terminal booting up).

## 4. Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Framework:** **Next.js 15 (App Router)** - For speed and SEO.
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS 4** - Variable-based, ultra-lean execution.
- **Animation:** **Framer Motion** - Complex orchestration of layout changes.
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Production), Netlify (Staging/Backup).
- **Clean Code:** TypeScript strict mode, ESLint.

### Component Architecture
1.  **`HypeSwitch`**: Context provider managing global text/theme state.
2.  **`NeuralHero`**: Canvas-based interactive background (using `react-three-fiber` or optimized lightweight shader).
3.  **`ServiceMatrix`**: Grid layout with hover-reveal details.
4.  **`TrustTimeline`**: Vertical scrolling timeline of Henry's career, verified by "data signatures" (icons confirming acquisitions/revenue).

## 6. Content Strategy: "The Adult in the Room"

- **No fluff.** Every sentence must earn its place.
- **Use technical precision.** "Orchestration" not "management". "Latency" not "slowness".
- **Call out the elephant.** Explicitly mention "Vendor Lock-in," "Hallucinations," and "Bill Shock."
